You can’t do much about the first, but the second is entirely up to you. Simply put, don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. This may seem like an elementary statement, but far too many bettors violate it, which leads to disastrous financial consequences.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s take a look at some tips for putting together a winning Magic betting strategy.<br>If you’re looking for an edge in your bets, one approach is to focus on season series. Orlando Magic have historically struggled against teams from the Southeast Division and had considerable success against Atlantic Division opponents in recent years.<br>Another approach is to focus on matchups. Certain players tend to excel against others. For example, Dwight Howard is a nightmare for opposing big men, while point guards often have trouble defending Jameer Nelson .<br>In addition, home court advantage is something to consider when betting on Orlando Magic games. The Magic are typically a better team at home than they are on the road and tend to win more games in Orlando than they do elsewhere.<br>All of these factors should be considered when wagering on NBA games, but they are particularly important when betting on Orlando Magic .</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-money-betting-on-NBA-games-Orlando-Magic"><a href="#How-to-make-money-betting-on-NBA-games-Orlando-Magic" class="headerlink" title="How to make money betting on NBA games Orlando Magic"></a>How to make money betting on NBA games Orlando Magic</h1><p>The Orlando Magic are a professional basketball team based in Orlando, Florida. The team competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The Magic are one of the most successful NBA franchises, having won five division titles and reached the NBA Finals twice.</p>
<p>As with any other sport, betting on NBA games can be profitable if you know what you’re doing. In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of NBA betting so that you can start making money today.</p>
<h1 id="Understand-the-odds"><a href="#Understand-the-odds" class="headerlink" title="Understand the odds"></a>Understand the odds</h1><p>The first thing you need to understand is how the odds work. In general, the odds reflect how likely each outcome is. For example, if the Magic are playing the Toronto Raptors, the odds might be 2:1 for Orlando to win. This means that for every $2 you gamble, you can win $1 back if Orlando wins. Conversely, it also means that for every $1 you gamble, you can only win $0.50 back if Orlando loses.</p>
<h1 id="Look-at-past-results"><a href="#Look-at-past-results" class="headerlink" title="Look at past results"></a>Look at past results</h1><p>It’s important to look at past results when betting on NBA games. This will give you an idea of which teams are typically more successful than others. For example, if the Magic have a good track record against the Raptors, then you might want to bet on them to win.</p>
<h1 id="Consider-injuries-and-other-factors"><a href="#Consider-injuries-and-other-factors" class="headerlink" title="Consider injuries and other factors"></a>Consider injuries and other factors</h1><p>In addition to past results, it’s important to consider other factors when betting on NBA games. For example, injuries can play a big role in deciding the outcome of a game. If one team is missing several key players, they may be at a disadvantage compared to their opponent. You should also take into account things like home court advantage and momentum going into a game.</p>
<h1 id="Win-more-money-betting-on-the-NBA-with-these-tips-Orlando-Magic"><a href="#Win-more-money-betting-on-the-NBA-with-these-tips-Orlando-Magic" class="headerlink" title="Win more money betting on the NBA with these tips Orlando Magic"></a>Win more money betting on the NBA with these tips Orlando Magic</h1><p> Chances are if you’re reading this, you like betting on the NBA. And if you like betting on the NBA, you want to maximize your potential profits. We’re here to help.</p>
<p>Below we offer some tips that should help you win more money betting on the NBA. None of these suggestions are guarantees, of course, but they should all help you make better decisions when betting on pro hoops.</p>
<p>Play the Totals</p>
<p>One way to increase your chances of winning when betting on the NBA is to focus on totals, or the combined score of both teams in a game. Over the past few seasons, totals have been more reliable than sides (or who will win a game outright). This is especially true in matchups between evenly matched teams.</p>
<p>For example, the Washington Wizards and Boston Celtics opened this season with a total of 204 points. The Wiz won 107-96 but failed to cover the spread as 2-point underdogs. If you had bet the total instead of Washington, you would have won outright.</p>
<p>Another example: On November 6th, 2017, the Golden State Warriors hosted the Dallas Mavericks. The Warriors were massive 26-point favorites and entered halftime up 67-49. However, they only managed to cover the spread by winning 118-107. If you had placed a bet on Dallas +26 points, you would have won big time. Conversely, if you had bet against them and taken GS -26 points, you would have lost your wager.</p>
<p>When it comes to totals betting in the NBA, it’s generally a safe bet to go with the over as long as both teams are playing reasonably well offensively.</p>
<p>Look for Uninformed Bettors When Betting Sides</p>
<p>This may seem unethical, but sports gambling is not a fair and equitable endeavor – at least not most of the time anyway. Bettors who don’t do their research or who don’t know what they’re doing tend to make poorer decisions than those who are more informed about matchups and injuries. This is especially true when it comes to sides (picking who will win a game outright). So if you can find an uninformed gambler to take -1 point with one team or +1 point with another team, your chances of winning increase significantly.</p>
<h1 id="Use-Injuries-As-A-Guide-When-Betting-Sides-And-Totals"><a href="#Use-Injuries-As-A-Guide-When-Betting-Sides-And-Totals" class="headerlink" title="Use Injuries As A Guide When Betting Sides And Totals"></a>Use Injuries As A Guide When Betting Sides And Totals</h1><p>  Injuries play a significant role in Sports and no sport is injury prone as Basketball . Most gamblers spend very little time looking into current injuries before placing their bets . This is usually not a problem when betting Totals because mismatches due to injuries are rare . But when betting Sides it can be critical .  For example , if Kevin Durant is out for Oklahoma City Thunder then they become huge underdogs against most opponents even though their offensive abilities havent changed . Toronto Raptors lost Kyle Lowry midway through last season , which made them much weaker contenders against Boston Celtics in Eastern Conference Playoffs .  In general , good teams with key players out tend to be dogs against better opponents while average or bad teams with key players out tend to be favoured by oddsmakers</p>
<h1 id="The-best-ways-to-make-money-betting-on-the-NBA-Orlando-Magic"><a href="#The-best-ways-to-make-money-betting-on-the-NBA-Orlando-Magic" class="headerlink" title="The best ways to make money betting on the NBA Orlando Magic"></a>The best ways to make money betting on the NBA Orlando Magic</h1><p>The NBA season is a time when many bettors make money. There are so many games each day, and different ways to bet on the games, that there are opportunities for profit almost every day. In this article, we will discuss some of the best ways to make money betting on the Orlando Magic.</p>
<p>One way to make money betting on the Orlando Magic is to bet against them. This may seem like an odd strategy, but it can be profitable. The reason this works is because the odds makers often set the lines too high for teams that are expected to lose. When you bet against a team that is expected to lose, you are getting better odds than you would if you bet on them to win.</p>
<p>Another way to make money betting on the Orlando Magic is to bet on them against the spread. This involves betting that they will win by more points than the spread in a given game. For example, if the Magic were playing the Charlotte Hornets and were favored by 7 points, you would bet that they would win by more than 7 points. If they won by 8 points or more, you would win your bet.</p>
<p>A third way to make money betting on the Orlando Magic is to bet on their totals. This involves betting on how many points will be scored in a given game by both teams combined. For example, if you think that there will be Over 198 points scored in the game between Orlando and Miami, then you would place a wager on that total. If 199 or more points are scored in the game, then you would win your wager.</p>

I am going to show you how to make an extra $10,000 by betting on the NBA.</p>
<p>The key to making money betting on the NBA is to only bet on games that you are confident in. You also need to have a solid understanding of the betting odds and how to read them.</p>
<p>The first step is to find a reputable sportsbook that offers good betting odds on the NBA. Once you have found a sportsbook, you need to create an account and deposit some money into it.</p>
<p>Next, you need to research each game and find the games that offer the best odds. You will want to bet on these games because they offer the best chance of making money.</p>
<p>Once you have found a game that you want to bet on, you need to calculate how much money you should bet on it. To do this, you need to divide your bankroll by the number of units you want to bet. This will give you the amount of money that you should bet on each game.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that you have a bankroll of $1,000 and you want to bet 3 units per game. This means that you should bet $333 on each game.</p>
<p>Now that you know how much money to bet on each game, it’s time to place your bets! Make sure to keep track of your wins and losses so that you can adjust your bets accordingly.</p>

        <h1 id="IRS-Tracks-Gambling-Winnings-amp-Losses-Via-Your-Social-Security-Number"><a href="#IRS-Tracks-Gambling-Winnings-amp-Losses-Via-Your-Social-Security-Number" class="headerlink" title="IRS Tracks Gambling Winnings &amp; Losses Via Your Social Security Number"></a>IRS Tracks Gambling Winnings &amp; Losses Via Your Social Security Number</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitors gambling winnings and losses in order to ensure accurate tax reporting. They do this by cross-referencing your social security number (SSN) with information reported on Form W2-G, which casinos and other gambling establishments are required to file for individuals who win more than $1,200 in a calendar year.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever won $600 or more at a casino, or anywhere else for that matter, you should expect to receive a Form W2-G from the IRS shortly after the end of the year. This form will list the amount you won and the corresponding taxes that were withheld. You will then be responsible for reporting this income on your tax return.</p>
<p>If you happen to lose more than you win at gambling, you can also claim those losses as tax deductions. This can help offset any taxable gambling income you may have earned. However, you can only claim gambling losses up to the amount of your wins. So if you won $1,000 but lost $1,500, you can only claim $500 in losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all gambling income is taxable. For example, if you hit a jackpot worth $5,000 but only walked away with $2,000 after taxes were withheld, only the $2,000 would be considered taxable income. The first $5,000 of winnings would be exempt from taxation.</p>
<p>As long as you report all of your gambling winnings and losses accurately on your tax return, there shouldn’t be any problems. However, if the IRS finds that you’ve failed to report any taxable income, they could impose penalties and interest charges accordingly. So it’s always best to play it safe and report everything properly!</p>
<h1 id="How-The-IRS-Knows-If-You’re-Gambling-And-What-They’ll-Do-About-It"><a href="#How-The-IRS-Knows-If-You’re-Gambling-And-What-They’ll-Do-About-It" class="headerlink" title="How The IRS Knows If You’re Gambling, And What They’ll Do About It"></a>How The IRS Knows If You’re Gambling, And What They’ll Do About It</h1><p>Gambling is a popular form of recreation for many people, but it can also be a source of tax problems for those not paying attention. The IRS keeps track of gambling income and expenses, and there are specific rules that taxpayers must follow to avoid penalties.</p>
<p>If you’re a gambler, it’s important to understand the tax implications of your activities. Here’s what you need to know about how the IRS knows if you’re gambling, and what they’ll do about it.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>How does the IRS know if someone is gambling?</p>
<p>The IRS monitors gambling income and expenses by looking at Form 1099-MISC, which is used to report miscellaneous income. This form is issued to anyone who receives more than $600 in payments from a gambling business in a year.</p>
<p>Gambling businesses include casinos, racetracks, lotteries, and other types of betting or wagering establishments. If you receive payments from any of these businesses, you will need to report them on Form 1099-MISC.</p>
<p>What happens if I don’t report my gambling income?</p>
<p>If you don’t report your gambling income, the IRS may consider you to be in violation of tax laws. You could face penalties, interest charges, and even criminal prosecution. It’s important to comply with all tax laws, including those related to gambling income and expenses.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Plans-To-Audit-Gamblers-In-2017"><a href="#IRS-Plans-To-Audit-Gamblers-In-2017" class="headerlink" title="IRS Plans To Audit Gamblers In 2017"></a>IRS Plans To Audit Gamblers In 2017</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that it will be targeting gamblers in its annual tax audit campaign this year.</p>
<p>The agency said that it will be focusing on taxpayers who “report little or no income from wages, but have substantial gambling winnings.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the IRS said that it will be looking at taxpayers’ gambling records and trying to determine whether they are reporting all of their winnings accurately.</p>
<p>“Gambling winnings are taxable income, and we want to make sure that all taxpayers are reporting them correctly,” said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.</p>
<p>Koskinen added that the agency is expecting to bring in an extra $1 billion in taxes from audits of gamblers this year.</p>
<p>Gamblers who are notified by the IRS that they are being audited should expect to provide evidence of their gambling winnings and losses. This could include copies of casino statements, betting slips, lottery tickets, and other records.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who are found to have underreported their gambling income could face penalties including fines and criminal prosecution.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-IRS-Can-Tell-If-You’ve-Been-Gambling"><a href="#How-The-IRS-Can-Tell-If-You’ve-Been-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How The IRS Can Tell If You’ve Been Gambling"></a>How The IRS Can Tell If You’ve Been Gambling</h1><p>The IRS has a number of ways to determine if someone has been gambling, and they can levy penalties if they find that you have not been reporting your gambling winnings correctly.</p>
<p>One way the IRS can tell if you’ve been gambling is through your bank account. If you have been making frequent deposits that are markedly different in size or frequency from your other transactions, the IRS may assume that you’ve been gambling and assess penalties.</p>
<p>Another way the IRS can tell if you’ve been gambling is by looking at your tax return. If you have claimed losses from gambling as a deduction on your tax return, but have not reported any winnings, the IRS may investigate and assess penalties.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid penalties from the IRS for gambling is to report all of your winnings and losses. This way, you can prove that you have been reporting your income accurately. If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income or deductions, be sure to speak with a qualified accountant or tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Warns-Of-Increased-Scrutiny-For-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#IRS-Warns-Of-Increased-Scrutiny-For-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS Warns Of Increased Scrutiny For Gambling Winnings"></a>IRS Warns Of Increased Scrutiny For Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced that it will be increasing its scrutiny of taxpayers who report gambling winnings. The agency stated that it will be closely examining all tax returns which include income from gambling, in an effort to crack down on tax evasion.</p>
<p>This announcement is likely to come as a surprise to many taxpayers, as gambling income has not been a focus of the IRS in recent years. However, the agency has recently made efforts to increase its enforcement of tax laws, and gambling income is an easy target for additional revenue.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who earn income from gambling should be aware of the increased scrutiny that they may face from the IRS. It is important to make sure that all gambling winnings are properly reported on your tax return, and to keep careful records of your gambling activity. If you are audited by the IRS, being able to produce records of your gambling wins and losses can help to minimize any penalties or taxes that you may owe.</p>

        <h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-How-Much-Gambling-Winnings-Can-Be-Written-Off-From-2017-Online-Casino"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-How-Much-Gambling-Winnings-Can-Be-Written-Off-From-2017-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies How Much Gambling Winnings Can Be Written Off From 2017 Online Casino"></a>IRS Clarifies How Much Gambling Winnings Can Be Written Off From 2017 Online Casino</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service has released updated guidance on how much gambling income can be deducted on tax returns for the 2017 tax year. The IRS states that taxpayers can only deduct losses up to the amount of their winnings.</p>
<p>For example, if a taxpayer won $1,000 in online casino games but also had $1,200 in gambling losses, they could only deduct $200 in losses on their tax return. This is unchanged from the previous guidance issued by the IRS.</p>
<p>The new guidance also clarified that taxpayers can only write off gambling income if it was obtained through legal means. So, gambling income earned through illegal activities such as betting on blackjack or bingo cannot be deducted.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new guidance clarified that taxpayers cannot deduct any expenses related to gambling, such as travel or lodging costs.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Write-Off-My-Gambling-Winnings-From-2017-Online-Casino"><a href="#Can-I-Write-Off-My-Gambling-Winnings-From-2017-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Can I Write-Off My Gambling Winnings From 2017 Online Casino?"></a>Can I Write-Off My Gambling Winnings From 2017 Online Casino?</h1><p>The answer to this question is yes, you can write off gambling winnings from online casino in your 2017 tax return. This is allowed by the IRS as long as the winnings are considered as taxable income.</p>
<p>In order to claim your gambling winnings as a deduction on your tax return, you will need to itemize your deductions. This means that you will need to file Form 1040 and attach Schedule A. Then you will list your gambling winnings on Line 21 of Schedule A.</p>
<p>Your total deduction for gambling losses and winnings cannot be more than the amount of your gambling income. So, if you only had $1,000 in gambling income during the year, then your total deduction for gambling losses and winnings would also be $1,000.</p>
<p>There are some other things to keep in mind when claiming gambling winnings as a deduction. First of all, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your wins. So, if you lost $2,000 during the year but only won $1,000, then you can only deduct $1,000 worth of losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Additionally, you need to be able to document your losses in order to claim them as a deduction. This means keeping records of all of your bets and wins throughout the year. If you cannot provide this documentation, then you will not be able to claim the losses as a deduction.</p>
<h1 id="Exact-Amount-Of-Gambling-Winnings-That-Can-Be-Written-Off-From-2017-Online-Casino"><a href="#Exact-Amount-Of-Gambling-Winnings-That-Can-Be-Written-Off-From-2017-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Exact Amount Of Gambling Winnings That Can Be Written Off From 2017 Online Casino"></a>Exact Amount Of Gambling Winnings That Can Be Written Off From 2017 Online Casino</h1><p>There are few people in the world who have never gambled in some way, shape, or form. Be it a friendly game of poker with friends, a $2 bet on a horserace, or investing in lottery tickets every week, gambling is a popular pastime for millions of people all around the globe.</p>
<p>For some, gambling can be a serious addiction that can ruin lives. For others, it’s simply a leisure activity that they enjoy in their free time. No matter what your stance on gambling may be, there’s no denying that it can be a profitable endeavor – especially if you’re lucky enough to win big.</p>
<p>But what happens when you win? How much of your casino winnings can you actually write off on your taxes?</p>
<p>According to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), gambling income is considered taxable and must be reported on your tax return. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos (both online and offline). However, there are a few exceptions that allow you to exclude some or all of your gambling income from your taxes.</p>
<p>One such exception is the “proof of loss” rule. This rule allows you to deduct losses up to the total amount of your gambling income for the year. So if you had $1,000 in gambling income for the year and $1,200 in losses, you can write off $1,200 of your losses and pay taxes on only $800 of your income.</p>
<p>Another exception is the “casual gambler” exception. This allows individuals who gamble only occasionally and don’t have other sources of income to exclude their gambling income from taxes altogether. So if you only gamble once or twice a year and don’t earn any other income from other sources, you don’t have to report any of your gambling winnings or losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Note that these exceptions only apply to casual gamblers and not professional gamblers. Professional gamblers must report all of their gambling income and losses on their tax returns.</p>
<p>So how much can you actually write off from your 2017 online casino winnings? The answer depends on how much you won and how often you gambled. If you’re a casual gambler who only gambles occasionally, then you can write off all of your gambling losses up to the total amount of your gambling income for the year. If you’re a more serious gambler who has other sources of income outside of gambling, then you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your net gambling profit – which is calculated by subtracting your total losses from your total wins).</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Of-My-Gambling-Winnings-Can-I-Write-Off-For-2017"><a href="#How-Much-Of-My-Gambling-Winnings-Can-I-Write-Off-For-2017" class="headerlink" title="How Much Of My Gambling Winnings Can I Write-Off For 2017?"></a>How Much Of My Gambling Winnings Can I Write-Off For 2017?</h1><p>As the end of 2017 rapidly approaches, many taxpayers are wondering just how much of their gambling winnings they can write-off on their taxes. The good news is that, in most cases, you can write-off a good portion of your gambling winnings. The bad news is that there are a few things you need to keep in mind when trying to claim your gambling losses as tax deductions. In this article, we will take a closer look at how gambling write-offs work and provide some tips on how to maximize your tax savings.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that you can only deduct gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. If you claim the standard deduction instead of itemizing, you cannot deduct your gambling losses. So, if you have other large expenses such as mortgage interest or property taxes, it may make sense to itemize even if your gambling losses are large.</p>
<p>Itemized deductions are claimed on Schedule A of your federal income tax return. In order to deduct your gambling losses, you will need to list them on Line 28 of Schedule A. Be sure to include the amount of your winnings as well as any associated expenses such as transportation, hotel stays, or meals. You can also deduct any lost wages due to traveling for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>There are a few things you need to keep in mind when claiming your gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 but had $1,500 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be incurred in connection with legal wagers. So, don’t try to claim illegal bets or wagers against friends as tax deductions!</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must have documentation to support your claims. This documentation could include canceled checks, bank statements, receipts, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming all of the above criteria are met, the IRS allows taxpayers to write off up to 50% of their net gambling winnings as a tax deduction. So, if you had $2,000 in net gambling winnings for the year and incurred $1,500 in related expenses, you would be able to write off $750 worth of those expenses on your taxes ($1,500 x 50%). Keep in mind that this is just a general guideline - always speak with an accountant or tax specialist about how specific rules and regulations may apply in your case.<br>Maximizing Your Gambling Loss Deductions<br>There are a few ways that taxpayers can maximize their deductions for gambling losses: </p>
<ul>
<li>If possible, try and bunch your spending together around major Las Vegas gaming wins. This way you can increase the amount of write-offs without having too much paperwork tracking every little expense! </li>
<li>Make sure that all of your related costs (transportation costs/hotel stays/meals) are accounted for when tallying up losses. </li>
<li>Save all documentation related to your gambling activities! This will make it easier for an accountant or tax specialist to help file accurate deductions come tax time</li>
</ul>

The good news is that, in general, gambling income is tax-free. The bad news is that there are a few exceptions. In this article, we’ll take a look at the max amount you can write-off for your gambling winnings from a 2017 online casino.</p>
<p>Section 2<br>Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, casinos, horse races, and other wagering activities. It also includes any proceeds from the sale of gambling chips, tokens, or tickets. Gambling losses are deductible to the extent of gambling winnings. This means that you can only write off your losses up to the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>Section 3<br>In order to claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you will need to report your winnings and losses on Form 1040, Schedule A. Line 21 of this form is where you will report your gambling income and losses. Be sure to include all of your gambling income and losses for the year on this line. You do not need to itemize deductions in order to claim your gambling losses.</p>
<p>Section 4<br>The most you can write-off for your gambling income in 2017 is $3,000. This includes both your winnings and losses from all types of gambling activities. If you have more than $3,000 in gambling income and losses for the year, then you will need to report the amount over $3,000 on line 22 of Form 1040, Schedule A.</p>
<p>Section 5<br>Keep in mind that only losses incurred during 2017 can be claimed on your tax return. If you have gambled in previous years but didn’t record any of your winnings or losses until 2017, then you cannot claim those losses on this year’s return. They must be claimed on a future return when they are actually incurred.</p>

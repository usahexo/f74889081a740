        <h1 id="What-is-haha-poker"><a href="#What-is-haha-poker" class="headerlink" title="What is haha poker?"></a>What is haha poker?</h1><p> haha poker is an online multiplayer poker game that is played with a deck of 54 cards. The game can be played by up to four players, and the goal is to score the most points by taking tricks and collecting cards.</p>
<p>The game is played in three rounds, and the player who takes the most tricks in each round scores two points. The player who collects the most cards overall scores two points. The first player to score 11 points wins the game.</p>
<p>haha poker can be played as either a team game or a individual game. In team mode, the players work together to take as many tricks as possible in each round. In individual mode, each player tries to take as many tricks as possible on their own.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-haha-poker"><a href="#How-to-play-haha-poker" class="headerlink" title="How to play haha poker"></a>How to play haha poker</h1><p>To play haha poker, you’ll need a deck of 54 cards and at least two players. You can also play with teams of up to four players.</p>
<p>The dealer deals out all of the cards, face down, so that each player has 13 cards. The remaining card is placed face up in the middle of the table, and this card is used as the trump suit for the game.</p>
<p>The player on the left of the dealer starts off by playing one card face up on the table. The next player then has two options: they can either play another card face up on top of the first card, or they can pick up both cards and add them to their hand. If they choose to play another card, then it must be of a different suit than the first card.</p>
<p>If a player chooses to pick up both cards, then they add them to their hand and become the new dealer. The next player then starts off by playing one card face up on the table. Play continues like this until all of the cards have been played.</p>
<p> At the end of each round, whoever played the highest card in the trump suit (or whichever suit was chosen as trump) takes all of the cards from the table and becomes winner of that round. The winner of each round scores two points – one point for winning and one point for taking most tricks (ties are not counted).</p>
<p> At the end of three rounds, whoever has scored 11 points or more is declared winner!</p>

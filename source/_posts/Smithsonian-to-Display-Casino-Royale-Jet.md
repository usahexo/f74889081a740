#  Smithsonian to Display Casino Royale Jet

The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum announced on Wednesday that it will display the original jet used in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale. The plane, a British-made BAE Systems Hawk T1, is on loan from the Ministry of Defence and is scheduled to be displayed in the museum's Milestones of Flight gallery starting in July. "This aircraft is an important part of our aviation history," said Allan Pollack, a curator at the museum.

The plane was flown by British stunt pilot Richard Browning for several of the movie's most death-defying scenes, including one where it races along the narrow edge of a cliff. "It was Le Bourget Air Show in France and we were doing a low flypast and as I pulled up I just saw an empty field below me," Browning recalled of the scene. "I thought 'Oh my God, I'm going to die.'"

The exhibit will also include a replica of the jet's cockpit, giving visitors an opportunity to see how some of the movie's stunts were performed. "We are very pleased to be able to share this significant artifact with our visitors," said Pollack.

#  Jet from Casino Royale up for Auction

Garage online has announced the sale of a 1957 Aston Martin DB3S, chassis no. DB3S/R/5700, famously piloted by Sir Jackie Stewart in the 1970 Targa Florio race. The car is being offered without reserve and is estimated to sell for $1.5 million - $2 million.

The car was originally built for racing legend Roy Salvadori, but was later bought by casino magnate and James Bond enthusiast, Howard Hughes. Hughes passed away in 1976 and the car was sold at auction in Las Vegas in 1978. It was later purchased by Japanese collector Shin Okamoto who kept it in his collection until this year.

The car is being offered in "barn find" condition and will require a full restoration. However, Garageonline believes that it could be one of the most historically significant Aston Martins to come to auction in many years.

The sale of the car comes just weeks after a genuine "James Bond ITALIAN Job" Mini Cooper used in the opening sequence of 1969 film "The Italian Job" sold for $478,000 at auction.

#  Mystery Jet from Casino Royale Revealed 

In 1967, a Lockheed Jetstar 814 was sold by Air America to the secretive Diamond Shamrock Corporation. The plane was used as a private jet for executives of the oil company.

In 2006, the plane was involved in an incident at London's Casino Royale. After crashing through the roof of the building, the plane came to a rest on the casino floor.

For years, the true identity of the plane's owner remained a mystery. But now, new evidence has come to light that reveals the plane's true owner.

According to documents released by the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was registered to none other than James Bond himself!

It seems that 007 used the plane as his personal getaway vehicle and often flew it to Europe for covert operations. After its ill-fated trip to Casino Royale, Bond apparently decided to sell it and it eventually ended up in the hands of Diamond Shamrock.

The plane sat dormant for many years until its discovery in 2006. Now, with its true identity revealed, it will be interesting to see what becomes of this mysterious piece of 007 history.

#  The Jet from Casino Royale is a MiG-21

The plane that appears in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale is a Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbed. The aircraft was used extensively by the air forces of over 60 countries, and has seen action in numerous conflicts since its introduction in 1959.

The MiG-21 is a single-engine fighter jet, and was designed as an interceptor aircraft. It has a top speed of Mach 2.2, and can reach an altitude of 58,000 feet. The Fishbed has been employed by both the air forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and has been used in combat in Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and other locations around the world.

The plane that appears in Casino Royale is a Russian-built MiG-21bis model, which entered service in 1974. The MiG-21bis is armed with a 30mm cannon and two R-27T heatseeking missiles. It can also carry up to 3,000 pounds of ordinance on four underwing hard points.

In Casino Royale, the plane is used by Le Chiffre to escape from MI6 agents following his defeat at the casino. He flies to Montenegro and inserts himself into a civil war taking place there, using his jet to bomb targets from the air. Bond eventually catches up to him and shoots him down with a Stinger missile, causing the jet to crash into the ocean.

Bond films are quintessentially British, and the latest installment – “Skyfall” – is no exception. The film features a stunning Jaguar C-X75 hybrid supercar, which is badged with the 007 logo and driven by James Bond (Daniel Craig) in several scenes.

The C-X75 made its debut in the opening scene of the film, where it’s used to chase a villain through the streets of Istanbul. This scene was shot on location, and Bond fans will be pleased to know that the car was actually driving down the real streets of Istanbul!

Later in the film, the C-X75 makes an appearance at the casino in Montenegro. This time, it’s been fitted with a flashing light bar and siren, making it perfect for chasing villains through crowded casinos!

The C-X75 is a plug-in hybrid supercar that produces 780 horsepower. It can reach a top speed of 220 mph and go from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.8 seconds. With such impressive performance figures, it’s no wonder that Bond chose this car for his latest adventure!

#  Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino to Reopen in October!

After a two-year closure for a $90 million renovation, the Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino will reopen in October with new amenities, including a convention center and 300-room hotel.

The casino has also been remodeled, with new high-limit gaming areas and a sports book. The hotel’s restaurant, Spencer’s, will offer an updated menu.

The casino is owned by the Mescalero Apache Tribe.

#  Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino Closed Indefinitely

The management of the Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino has announced that the hotel and casino will be closed indefinitely. This follows several months of mounting financial difficulties for the property.

Mountain Gods Casino Resort opened in December of 2016, with much fanfare. It was billed as a luxurious new resort destination in southern New Mexico, with 261 guest rooms and suites, a 75,000-square-foot casino, 11 restaurants and bars, and a wide range of entertainment and recreational amenities. The hotel was especially popular among those looking for an escape from the cold winters of the northeast United States.

However, since its opening the property has faced significant financial challenges. In May of 2018 the casino resort filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing $135 million in debt. At that time it was reported that the resort was losing $1 million per month.

The latest announcement that the hotel and casino will be closed indefinitely is likely to result in even more job losses at the resort. As of May 2018 there were over 1,000 employees at Mountain Gods Casino Resort.

#  Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino to Remain Closed for Six Months

Officials at the Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino announced that the casino will be closed for six months beginning in November. The closure is part of a renovation project that will include upgrades to the casino's gaming floor, food and beverage options, as well as its guest rooms.

The renovations are expected to cost around $12 million and are hoped to help revive interest in the casino, which has seen declining profits in recent years. "The goal is to make Mountain Gods more relevant, both regionally and nationally," said Juan Ayala, senior vice president and general manager of the casino.

The closure is expected to result in the loss of around 400 jobs, but officials say that most of those employees will be able to be transferred to other properties owned by the Pueblo of Pojoaque gaming company. "We understand this is a difficult time for our team members and their families," said Ayala. "But we believe these changes will help us better compete in today's market and provide a better experience for our guests."

Work on the renovation project is slated to begin in November and is expected to be completed by May 2019.

#  Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino to Reopen in November with New Management

The Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino will reopen in November after being closed for more than a year. The casino will have new management, as well as a new name.

The casino, which is located in Ruidoso, New Mexico, will be operated by an American Indian tribe called the Mescalero Apache Tribe. The tribe has not released any details about the new management or the new name for the casino.

The closure of the Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino was due to financial difficulties. The casino had been losing money for several years, and its debt had reached more than $100 million. In order to avoid bankruptcy, the casino was forced to close in November 2016.

Since then, the tribe has been working on a plan to revive the casino. They reached an agreement with lenders in February 2018 that would allow them to reopen the casino.

The Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino is one of the largest casinos in New Mexico. It has more than 1,000 slot machines and 30 table games.

#  Work Begins on Renovations of Hemingway Hotel of the Mountain Gods Casino

Work began this week on a $15 million renovation of the Hemingway Hotel at the Mountain Gods Casino Resort in Ruidoso, New Mexico. The renovation will include a new lobby, restaurant, casino floor, and hotel rooms.

The Hemingway Hotel was originally built in 1982 as part of the casino resort. The hotel has been closed for the past two years for the renovations.

The new lobby will have a rustic feel with stone floors and a large fireplace. The restaurant will be called "The Grill" and will serve American cuisine. The casino floor will have 400 slot machines and 14 table games. The hotel rooms will be updated with new furniture, fixtures, and finishes.

"We are excited to begin this renovation project," said Chad Baldwin, director of marketing for the Mountain Gods Casino Resort. "The Hemingway Hotel is an important part of our history and we are committed to making it a world-class destination."

The renovations are expected to be completed by December 2017.

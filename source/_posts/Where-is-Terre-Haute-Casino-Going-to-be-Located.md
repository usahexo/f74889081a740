#  Where is Terre Haute Casino Going to be Located?

Some people are wondering where the Terre Haute casino is going to be located. The popular gaming destination is expected to be built in Vigo County, which is just west of the city of Terre Haute. This will make it a convenient spot for many people who live in the area.

The new casino resort is going to be named Hollywood Casino Terre Haute. It will offer a wide variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker. In addition, there will be a hotel, restaurants, and other amenities on site.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place in late September of 2017. Construction is expected to be completed in 2019. This means that the casino will be up and running by the end of next year.

This new casino is definitely going to be a boon for the economy of Vigo County. It is estimated that it will create more than 1,000 jobs during the construction phase alone. Once it is operational, it will employ more than 1,500 people. In addition, the casino is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue each year for local businesses and government entities.

If you're looking for a great place to gamble and enjoy other amenities, Hollywood Casino Terre Haute is definitely worth checking out!

On Wednesday, theLocation of the new casino has been announced by the owner of the land, Pinnacle Entertainment. The $85 million casino will be built on a 72-acre site near I-70 and will include a hotel, a 122,000-square-foot gaming floor, and multiple restaurants. This new casino is expected to create over 700 jobs and bring in an estimated $156 million in annual revenue for Terre Haute.

“We are excited about this project because it means more jobs and revenue for Terre Haute,” Mayor Duke Bennett said. “It’s also going to be a great amenity for our community with the hotel and restaurants that will be part of it.”

The new casino will compete with the two existing casinos in Terre Haute, Horseshoe Southern Indiana and Tropicana Evansville. But Pinnacle Entertainment CEO Anthony Sanfilippo is confident that the new casino will be successful.

“This market is underserved based on population size and gaming needs so there is a lot of opportunity here,” Sanfilippo said.

Construction on the new casino is expected to begin in early 2019 with a completion date in late 2020.

#   Is Terre Haute casino headed for riverfront property?

The Terre Haute casino is in the early stages of planning and could be headed for the riverfront, according to a report by the Tribune-Star.

Mayor Duke Bennett said he met with representatives from the casino last week and that they are interested in property on the east side of the Wabash River, between Sixth and Seventh streets.

“They’re still in the due diligence stage, so there’s no contract or anything like that, but they were very serious about it and asked a lot of questions,” Bennett said. “It sounds like they want to be downtown.”

Bennett said he is open to having a casino come to Terre Haute but that any deal would have to include an agreement that the revenue generated would help fund infrastructure improvements in the city.

A spokesperson for Boyd Gaming, which owns Terre Haute casino, declined to comment on whether the company was interested in moving its property to downtown Terre Haute.

If the casino moves downtown, it would be just blocks away from another riverfront property – Hulman Motorsports Park. That could create some traffic congestion concerns, but Bennett said he believes there is enough room for both ventures to flourish.

“There’s plenty of opportunity down there, and I don’t think it would be a detriment to either one of them,” he said.

#   New Terre Haute casino to be developed near downtown

A new casino is planned to be developed near downtown Terre Haute, just across the Wabash River from Illinois. The casino will be developed and owned by Penn National Gaming, one of the largest casino operators in the United States.

Plans for the new casino were announced earlier this week, and it is expected to create as many as 1,000 new jobs in the area. The casino will include a hotel and a variety of restaurants and other attractions.

Penn National Gaming already operates a casino in Terre Haute, but the new facility will be much larger. It is expected to cost $150 million to build and will cover nearly 200,000 square feet.

The news of the new casino has been welcomed by city officials and local residents. "This is great news for Terre Haute," said Mayor Duke Bennett. "The new casino will create jobs and generate revenue for our city."

One resident said that she was looking forward to trying out the new casino. "I'm excited about it," she said. "I think it will be a lot of fun and it will be good for the economy."

#   Proposed location for new Terre Haute casino revealed

The proposed site for the new Terre Haute casino has been revealed. The chosen location is on the city’s east side, just south of Interstate 70. The $100 million casino project is expected to create up to 1,000 jobs.

City officials are excited about the potential benefits of the new casino. Mayor Duke Reberger commented, “This is a great project that will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to our city. We are very pleased that an experienced company like Penn National has decided to invest in Terre Haute.”

Penn National already operates casinos in Charleston, Effingham, and Springfield. Company officials say they are confident the Terre Haute casino will be a success. Rodney Schad, regional president for Penn National, said, “We are very impressed with the potential of the Terre Haute market and we believe this property has great potential as a gaming and entertainment destination.”

The new casino will feature 700 slot machines and 30 table games. It will also have a full-service restaurant and a bar. Construction is expected to begin later this year and the casino should be open by early 2020.

#  Poker least profitable table game in Chile casinos

Poker is the least profitable table game in Chilean casinos, returning just 60.8% of players’ money on average, according to a study by researchers at the University of Chile.

Blackjack, which returned 71.2%, was the next-worst game for players, followed by roulette (70.3%), baccarat (69.0%) and craps (68.8%). slot machines were the best option for gamblers in Chilean casinos, returning 91.5% of players’ money on average.

The study also found that poker is the most popular table game in Chile, with almost half of all players opting for it. Blackjack was second most popular, attracting around a quarter of all players, while roulette was third most popular with around one-in-ten players.

#  Blackjack poorest paying table game in Chilean gambling venues

A study carried out at the beginning of 2018 by the research company Cuantica showed that blackjack is the table game in Chilean casinos offering the lowest payout percentage. The study observed a payout percentage of only 89.8%, while games such as roulette and baccarat offer much higher payout percentages of 97.3% and 98.9% respectively.

Interestingly, these findings are in stark contrast to those of a similar study conducted six years ago, which found blackjack to have the highest payout percentage of all table games. So what could be causing this shift?

There are a few possible explanations for why blackjack is now paying out less than other table games. One possibility is that blackjack has become more popular with players in recent years, meaning there is more competition amongst players for winning hands, leading to smaller payouts overall. Another possibility is that casinos may be deliberately decreasing the payout percentage on blackjack in order to make more money from players. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that blackjack no longer offers the best chance of winning at Chilean casinos.

#  Roulette offers the worst odds for casino customers in Chile

_Casinos in Chile are required by law to post the minimum and maximum odds for all casino games. For roulette, the casino must post both the minimum and the maximum bet that can be placed on a single bet._

Minimum bet: 1,000 Chilean pesos (CLP)

Maximum bet: 10 million CLP

The relatively high minimum bet at Chilean casinos means that roulette offers the worst odds for casino customers. The house edge on a European roulette table is 2.7%, which means that the casino will win an average of $2.70 for every $100 wagered. For comparison, blackjack has a house edge of around 0.5%, meaning that the casino will only win an average of $0.50 for every $100 wagered. This makes blackjack a far better option for players looking to improve their chances of winning money from the casino.

#  Baccarat generates the lowest profits for casinos in Chile

Casinos in Chile generate the lowest profits from Baccarat when compared to other casino games, according to a study by the research company EGM.

The study found that Baccarat generated an average of just 2.7% in casino profits, while slots generated an average of 9.8%, roulette came in at 18.9%, and blackjack at 26%.

This is likely due to the fact that Baccarat is a game of chance that is relatively easy to learn, which means that there is less opportunity for casinos to profit from player mistakes.

#  Craps is the least profitable table game for Chilean casinos

According to a study recently released by the Universidad de Concepción, Craps is the least profitable table game for Chilean casinos. The study, conducted over a period of six months, analyzed data from more than 16 million transactions at 78 Chilean casinos.

Craps ranked as the worst game in terms of profitability, with just a 2.76% return on investment (ROI). In comparison, Blackjack had a 5.47% ROI, while Poker had a 7.06% ROI. Roulette was not far behind Craps, with a 3.02% ROI.

The study also found that the average casino in Chile earns just 1.37% of its total revenue from Craps tables. This low percentage is due in part to the high house edge for this game – around 11%.

Casinos in Chile are not likely to abandon Craps anytime soon, however. The game is popular with players and has a high level of excitement and energy. Nevertheless, casino operators may want to consider offering more Blackjack and Poker games to attract players who are looking for better returns on their investment.

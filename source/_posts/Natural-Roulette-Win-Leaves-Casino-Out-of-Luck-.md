#  Natural Roulette Win Leaves Casino Out of Luck 

Las Vegas, Nevada - A patron of the Silverton Casino Hotel in Las Vegas won big playing roulette over the weekend, walking away with a little more than $269,000 after betting on a natural 24.

According to casino officials, the unidentified gambler placed a single chip on red and watched as the wheel came to a stop on black. When the ball landed in slot number 24, the player's bet was paid out at 36-1 odds, resulting in the six-figure payday.

"We're always happy to see our customers win, but particularly when they beat the house by going against the odds," said Silverton spokesperson Monica Killingsworth. "It was an impressive show of luck."

The casino has yet to determine if it will offer the player a complimentary stay or other reward for their big win.

#  Player Hits a Natural on First Spin, Wins Big 

At the casino, one player hit a lucky streak on the very first spin of the day. Sitting down at a blackjack table, they placed their bet and hit a natural on the first card. This gave them an immediate win of $1,000.

#  What Does the Natural Mean in Roulette? 

Players sometimes mistakenly believe that the natural on a roulette table is a winning bet. In fact, there is no natural in roulette - the term simply refers to the order of numbers on the wheel. A natural is when the ball lands on one of the numbers in the sequence from 1 to 36. The house edge for a single number bet is 5.26%, so a player who bets on a natural will lose almost 95% of the time.

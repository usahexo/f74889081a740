#  What is Double Exposure?

A double exposure is what photographers sometimes call taking two pictures and merging them into one. This technique can be used to achieve creative effects, like surrealism or a feeling of motion. It can also be used to correct technical problems with photos, like underexposure or overexposure.

The term “double exposure” usually refers to images that are shot on film and then combined in a darkroom. With the advent of digital photography, it’s now also possible to create double exposures in Photoshop or other image editing software.

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating double exposures:

1) The images should be complementary – that is, they should work together to create a cohesive whole.

2) Try not to have too much overlap between the two images.

3) Be careful not to have any prominent subjects in both images – if the subject is in one image, it will likely be hidden in the other.

4) Experiment! There are no rules when it comes to creating double exposures – just have fun with it!

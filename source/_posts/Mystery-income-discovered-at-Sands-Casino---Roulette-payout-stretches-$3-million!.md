The lucky winner was playing roulette at the gambling establishment on December 30th when they placed their bet on red and won - netting themselves an incredible $3 million.

Security footage from the casino floor has been checked but no clues have been found as to who is behind the win.

#  Roulette payout mystery at Sands Casino revealed - $1.3 million comes from a single spin!

It was a moment that poker and casino players around the world were waiting for. The big Roulette payout at Sands Casino. But what was even more shocking was where the money came from. A single spin on the Roulette wheel resulted in a payout of $1.3 million!

As soon as the news hit the internet, everyone wanted to know what caused the massive win. Just as quickly, casino officials went into damage control mode, seeking to keep the specifics of how and where the money was won a secret.

What could cause such a remarkable payout? Rumors began to circulate that a high-roller had placed a massive bet on a single number and hit the jackpot. Or perhaps there was some sort of glitch with the Roulette wheel that resulted in an abnormally high payout.

But as it turns out, neither of those things were responsible for the big win. The true story behind the $1.3 million Roulette payout is far more mundane than anyone could have guessed. It all started with a simple wager on blackjack...

The story begins with an unidentified gambler who was playing blackjack at Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This gambler had been betting small amounts on each hand, but decided to make a bigger bet on one particular hand. He put down $5,000 on a hand that he thought would give him a good chance of winning. Unfortunately for him, he lost that hand and his entire bankroll along with it.

 sensing that he was about to lose big, the gambler asked the dealer to hit him one more time with his remaining $5,000 bet. The dealer obliged and he lost again - this time losing everything he had brought to the table.

Desperate to try and recoup his losses, the gambler turned to roulette. He put down $1,000 on red and watched as the ball landed on black - meaning his original bet plus another $1,000 had just vanished into thin air!

Determined not to go home empty handed, he put down his final $3,000 on black (the same color as his previous two bets). This time however, luck was finally on his side and the ball landed on black again! Resulting in a total win of $1,300 - just enough to cover his losses from blackjack!

#  Mystery Income at Sands Casino: Roulette Wheel Keeps Paying Out Huge Sums

A roulette wheel at the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania has been paying out large sums of money to players over the last few weeks. On November 10th, 2017, the casino announced that a player had hit a $1.5 million jackpot on the roulette wheel. That same day, another player won $167,000. Then, just two days later, another player took home $77,000 from the same roulette wheel.

This is not the first time that this particular roulette wheel has produced big winners. In September of 2017, two separate players walked away with $211,000 and $156,000, respectively. So what's causing this roulette wheel to pay out such large sums of money?

Some believe that the casino may be rigging the game in order to produce these large payouts. However, casino officials insist that there is nothing wrong with the roulette wheel and that it is simply running hot lately. They believe that these large payouts are simply due to chance and luck.

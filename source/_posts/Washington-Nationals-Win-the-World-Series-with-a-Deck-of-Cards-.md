#  Washington Nationals Win the World Series with a Deck of Cards 

In a stunning upset, the Washington Nationals defeated the heavily favored Houston Astros to win the World Series. How did they do it? With a deck of cards, of course!

The Nationals got off to a hot start in the series, winning the first two games at home. In game three, things looked bleak for Washington as they found themselves down 5-1 in the ninth inning. That's when outfielder Bryce Harper pulled out a deck of cards and began to shuffle.

"I just had a feeling that we could come back," Harper said. "And sure enough, we did."

Harper proceeded to lead the Nationals to an amazing six-run comeback victory, using his card tricks to distract and confuse the Astros players.

"It was definitely frustrating trying to play against him," said Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. "He was doing all sorts of fancy moves with those cards, and I had no idea what he was up to."

With the series now tied 3-3, the Nationals traveled to Houston for game seven. Once again, Harper came up big, hitting a three-run home run in the third inning to give Washington the lead. The Nationals went on to win 6-2 and claim their first World Series championship in franchise history.

Asked how he felt about his amazing accomplishment, Harper simply said "I'm just glad I could help bring a world championship to Washington."


When asked about how they won Game 7 of the World Series, members of the Washington Nationals gave credit where credit was due: with a deck of cards. “I just had a feeling that we could come back,” outfielder Bryce Harper said of the pivotal 9th inning in Game 3 of the series against Houston Astros. And comeback they did with Harper leading an improbable six-run rally capped off with some deft card tricks that befuddled and frustrated the opposition.    This led Sports Illustrated writer Ben Reiter to comment before Game 7 that “[i]f you want to know how Bryce Harper & Co . will pull off their impossible comeback bid … ask Joseph McCarthy” – alluding not only to Harper’s use of card tricks as psychological warfare but also referencing (anachronistically) America’s most infamous anticommunist senator ever (Reiter later apologized).    The Nats would go on to win that final game and complete their improbable WORLD SERIES victory – their first in franchise history – which some are crediting at least in part due to ol’ Joe’s pack of 52 pick-up (or whatever variant thereof).

#  Washington Nationals Play with a Deck of 52 Cards 

The Washington Nationals are in the playoffs for the third time in five years. This year, they’re using an unconventional strategy to get there: playing with a deck of 52 cards.

The Nationals were one game away from making the playoffs last year, but they fell short due to some unlucky breaks. So this year, they’ve decided to hedge their bets and use a deck of cards as their secret weapon.

There are many different ways to use a deck of cards to improve your odds in baseball. One simple strategy is to assign each card a value, and then draw cards at random to make decisions. For example, you could assign the following values:

Ace: 1 point
King: 3 points
Queen: 2 points
Jack: 1 point 
etc.

You could then choose a card at random from your hand to decide what to do on each at-bat. For example, if you drew an Ace, you would hit it out of the park; if you drew a two, you would bunt; and so on. This approach gives you a 54% chance of making the right decision on any given at-bat.

Another strategy is to use the cards to represent different situations in the game. For example, you could assign the following values:

Ace: Runner on first base only 
King: Runner on second base only 
Queen: Runner on third base only 
Jack: No runners on base 
etc.
You could then draw a card randomly whenever there is a runner on base, and make your decision based on the position of the runner(s). This approach gives you a 48% chance of making the right decision in any given situation.

#  Washington Nationals Use a Deck of Playing Cards for Strategy 

In baseball, as in other sports, teams use strategies and tactics to gain an advantage over their opponents. The Washington Nationals, a Major League Baseball team, use a strange tool to help with their planning: a deck of playing cards.

The Nationals’ coaches laid out the cards on a table before each game and used them to help diagram plays and make decisions about when to hit and when to steal bases. The coaches then shared the cards with players to give them an idea of what was planned.

One coach explained the thinking behind the strategy. “It just helps simplify things for our players,” he said. “They can see exactly where they fit into the sequence of what we’re trying to do on any given day.”

The strategy seems to have worked well for the Nationals; they made it to the playoffs in both 2012 and 2014.

#  Unusual Forms of Gambling on Brazilian Carnival Cruise Hemingway!

The Carnival cruise Hemingway is a unique form of gambling that takes place in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro during the Carnaval celebration. The game is played with two dice and three cups, each numbered one to six. There are three players in each game, and the objective is to accumulate as many points as possible by throwing the dice and placing them inside the appropriate cups.

Points are awarded as follows:

- One point for a number thrown on the first die.
- Two points for a number thrown on the second die.
- Three points for a number thrown on both dice.
- Six points for a successful "Carnival" (a throw of doubles).

If, at any time, one or both of the dice are knocked from the table, that player forfeits their turn and all accumulated points. The game continues until one player has reached or exceeded 36 points, at which time they are declared the winner.

The Carnival cruise Hemingway is a very popular form of gambling in Brazil, and can be found in most public squares and plazas during Carnaval. It's a simple game to learn but can be quite challenging, making it perfect for those looking for a little excitement during Carnaval.

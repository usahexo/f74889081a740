#  Slot-Lovers' Showdown: Who Has More Players, Online Casino Or Vegas Slots?

Slot-lovers, it’s time to face the music. Who REALLY has more players? Online casino games or Vegas slots?

It’s a hard question to answer, but we’re going to try. First of all, let’s take a look at some numbers. In 2005, there were only about 9 million online casino players. Compare that to the 2013 stats which show over 114 million slot machine players! Slot machines have definitely taken over as the favorite gambler pastime.

But what about revenue? Surely, with so many more players, online casinos must be raking in more cash than Vegas casinos? Actually, no. The average Vegas casino takes in about $5 million per day in revenue compared to the $2 million pulled in by online casinos. So why do people prefer slot machines over other casino games?

Well, for one thing, slots are incredibly easy to play. You don’t need any strategy or skill – just put in your bet and hit the button. And since they payout more often than any other casino game (about 95% of the time), people feel like they have a better chance of winning when they play slots. Add in the bright lights and bells and whistles of a Vegas casino and it’s easy to see why slots reign supreme!

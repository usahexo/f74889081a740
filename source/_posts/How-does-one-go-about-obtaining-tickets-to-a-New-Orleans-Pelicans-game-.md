#  What is the team's history?

The Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Tigers compete in the American League Central division of Major League Baseball (MLB). One of eight charter franchises of the American League, the club was founded in Detroit in 1894 as part of the Western League. (Wikipedia)

The Detroit Tigers were one of the first teams in baseball. Formed in 1894, they were part of the Western League and competed against other teams in Michigan and Ohio. In 1901, they joined the American League and continued to play against their regional rivals.

The Detroit Tigers have had a few periods of success throughout their history, but they have mostly been a mediocre team. They made it to the World Series three times – once in 1945, once in 1968, and once in 1984 – but they never actually won it all. In fact, their last championship came back in 1984 when they defeated the San Diego Padres.

More recently, the Detroit Tigers have been struggling to keep up with some of the better teams in baseball. They’ve failed to make it to the playoffs for six consecutive seasons now, and it doesn’t look like things are going to get much better anytime soon.

#  Wizards Score First Win of Year Against Suns

The Wizards were in desperate need of a win, and they got it on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns. Washington scored the first basket of the game and never looked back, cruising to a 118-102 victory.

John Wall led the way for the Wiz with 27 points and 13 assists. Bradley Beal added 25 points, and Otto Porter contributed 18 points and 10 rebounds. The victory was Washington's first of the season, and it came at just the right time; they play eight of their next nine games on the road.

"We talked about it before the game that this is a must-win for us," Wall said afterward. "It wasn't pretty, but we got the job done."

The Suns had no answer for Wall, who penetrated the defense at will and found his teammates for easy baskets. Phoenix head coach Jay Triano said after the game that his team "didn't do a good job of staying in front of him."

The Wizards will look to build on this win as they continue their road trip in Oklahoma City on Wednesday night.

#  Washington Wizards Remain on the Road to Playoff Hopes

The Washington Wizards (24-21) continue to hold onto their playoff hopes, as they inch closer to the .500 mark. After starting out the season 2-8, it looked as if the Wizards were in for another disappointing year. However, Washington has since gone on a 22-13 run to put themselves back into contention for a postseason berth.

While veterans like John Wall (19.4 ppg, 9.3 apg) and Bradley Beal (20.7 ppg) have carried much of the load offensively, several young players have also contributed to the Wizards’ success. Otto Porter Jr. (13.7 ppg), Tomas Satoransky (7.0 ppg, 4.5 apg), and Kelly Oubre Jr. (9.9 ppg) have all seen their production increase as the season has progressed.

One of Washington’s biggest strengths has been their defense, which ranks 8th in the NBA in terms of points allowed per game (102.3). In addition, they are 2nd in the league in defensive rating (101.1), behind only the Golden State Warriors. This is largely due to head coach Scott Brooks’ emphasis on team defense and his ability to get the most out of his players.

Looking ahead, Washington still has a lot of work to do in order to secure a playoff spot. They are currently 5th in the Eastern Conference, but just 2 games ahead of 9th place Miami Heat. With 18 games remaining on their schedule, there is still plenty of time for teams to make a pushes for playoff positioning.

The Wizards will need to continue playing well defensively if they want to make a run at the playoffs. In addition, they will need John Wall and Bradley Beal to stay healthy and continue scoring at a high level. If they can do that, there is no doubt that Washington can make some noise in the East come playoff time

#  Washington Wizards Hope to Secure Playoff Berth Tonight

The Washington Wizards have their sights set on a playoff berth as they take the court against the lowly Atlanta Hawks tonight. Washington is coming off a victory over the Miami Heat on Saturday and will be looking to build some momentum heading into the postseason.

The Wizards currently sit in sixth place in the Eastern Conference standings, but they are just one game ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks and two games ahead of the Detroit Pistons. A loss tonight could potentially drop Washington all the way down to eighth place, so they will need to play well against Atlanta.

Washington has been led by Bradley Beal this season. The 24-year-old is averaging 23 points, four rebounds, and three assists per game. He has stepped up his game since All-Star point guard John Wall went down with a knee injury, and he will need to continue playing at a high level if Washington wants to make a playoff run.

The Hawks have had a disappointing season and currently occupy last place in the East with a record of 20-50. They have not won back-to-back games since January and do not appear to be much of a threat to Washington tonight.

However, you can never underestimate an NBA team facing elimination, so the Wizards cannot afford to take Atlanta lightly. If they come out focused and play their best basketball, they should be able to secure a playoff berth tonight.

#  NBA Odds: Washington Wizards at Home Against Toronto Raptors

The Washington Wizards will be at home against the Toronto Raptors in this matchup of Eastern Conference foes. The Wizards are sixth in the Eastern Conference with a record of 37-30, while the Raptors are second with a record of 47-20.

Washington is led by John Wall and Bradley Beal, who are averaging 20.5 and 20.4 points per game, respectively. Otto Porter Jr. is also averaging over 13 points per game, and Marcin Gortat is averaging nearly 10 rebounds per game.

Toronto is led by DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, who are both averaging over 21 points per game. Jonas Valanciunas is averaging almost 12 rebounds per game, and Patrick Patterson is averaging over six rebounds per game.

In their last meeting on January 11th, the Raptors won 116-106. DeRozan led all scorers with 34 points, while Lowry added 23 points and 11 assists. Wall led the Wizards with 28 points and 11 assists, while Porter contributed 27 points off the bench.

The Raptors currently lead the season series 2-1. In their previous matchup on March 4th, Washington won 116-106 behind 30 points from Beal and 22 points from Wall. Lowry led Toronto with 29 points in that contest.

Both teams come into this matchup playing well; Washington has won six of their last ten games, while Toronto has won seven of their last ten games. However, Washington has been very good at home this season, going 24-8 overall and 15-3 against conference opponents. Given that Toronto is only 6-5 on the road against conference opponents, it looks like Washington may have the advantage in this one.

However, the Raptors have been one of the best teams in the NBA this season and should not be counted out easily. They have a lot of talent across their roster and should be able to compete with Washington toe-to-toe in this contest. Ultimately, this matchup should provide some good entertainment for fans watching!

#  What is the Atlanta Braves? 

The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The franchise competes in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. The Braves play their home games at SunTrust Park, which opened in 2017.

The Braves were founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings, one of the eight teams that constituted the American Association (AA). The team changed its name to the Braves in 1911. In 1952, the franchise moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, and then relocated to Atlanta in 1966. They returned to Milwaukee in 1995, before moving back to Atlanta in 1997. The Atlanta Braves are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America.

The Braves have won three World Series titles: 1914, 1957, and 1995. The franchise has also won 17 divisional titles, including five while playing in Milwaukee and 12 while playing in Atlanta.

The Braves were a charter member of the NL in 1876 and became an affiliate of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs) that season. In 1883, they joined the St. Louis Browns (now known as the Baltimore Orioles) in a cross-league rivalry that would last until 1890.
Eddie Mathews is the most celebrated player in franchise history, with three MVP Awards and a batting championship to his name. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. Hank Aaron spent 21 seasons with the franchise, setting multiple team and league records that still stand today. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. 

The Atlanta Braves have had 46 managers since 1871. Bobby Cox is the all-time leader for wins with 1408 and also holds records for losses (1094), games managed (2558), and postseason appearances (15). 


#  What is Hemingway? 

Hemingway is a writing app for macOS that helps you write better by highlighting complex sentences and common errors.

It was created by developers at Agile Tortoise, the same company that brought us the popular to-do list app, Things.

# How does Hemingway work? 

Simply put, Hemingway examines your writing and highlights areas where it can be improved.

For example, it will identify long, complex sentences and suggest ways to break them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. It will also highlight words and phrases that are commonly overused or could be replaced with something stronger.

# Is Hemingway right for me? 

That’s a tough question to answer. Hemingway is definitely not for everyone. But if you’re looking for a tool to help you write better, then it’s worth giving it a try.
